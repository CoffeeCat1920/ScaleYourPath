# Tital: Scale your path

# Abstraction: 
A ball roll game where your goal is to reach a goal to complete the but, *BUT* there is twist. There are no actual platforms to jump or climb. The player must create their own platformer by input a set of vectors which are to be ploted on a cartisian plane making a platform for ball to roll on.

# Functional Requirement 
- Functionality to display graphics.
- A system for graphically, ploting graphs on a cartisian plane.
- A system for handeling input from user and updating the graphics.
- System to restart levels.
- A tutorial system.
- Collision detection between different surfaces.
- Sliding the player for horizontal movement.
- Handeling jump physics for vertical movement.
- A level editor.
- A system to store highscore.
- Some good graphics.

# Tools
- *C++* for programming the game.
- *Git* for syncronizing the project.
- *Neovim* as programming enviroment with *gcc* compiler.
- *Raylib* library for display graphics, handeling input and updating graphics.
- *Raysound* for sound.
- *Cmath* and *RayShape* for ploting graphic.
- *Gnu Image Manipulation Programming* making graphics.
