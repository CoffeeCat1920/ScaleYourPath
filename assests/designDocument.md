- A system for handeling input from user and updating the graphics.
- System to restart levels.
- A tutorial system.
- Collision detection between different surfaces.
- Sliding the player for horizontal movement.
- Handeling jump physics for vertical movement.
- A level editor.
- A system to store highscore.
- Some good graphics.

# Tools
- *C++* for programming the game.
- *Git* for syncronizing the project.
